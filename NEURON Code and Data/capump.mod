TITLE decay of submembrane calcium concentration
:
: Internal calcium concentration due to calcium currents and pump.
: Differential equations.
:
: This file contains two mechanisms:
:
: 1. Simple model of ATPase pump with 3 kinetic constants (Destexhe 1992)
:
:       Cai + P <-> CaP -> Cao + P  (k1,k2,k3)
:
:   A Michaelis-Menten approximation is assumed, which reduces the complexity
:   of the system to 2 parameters: 
:       kt = <tot enzyme concentration> * k3  -> TIME CONSTANT OF THE PUMP
:	kd = k2/k1 (dissociation constant)    -> EQUILIBRIUM CALCIUM VALUE
:   The values of these parameters are chosen assuming a high affinity of 
:   the pump to calcium and a low transport capacity (cfr. Blaustein, 
:   TINS, 11: 438, 1988, and references therein).  
:
:   For further information about this this mechanism, see Destexhe, A. 
:   Babloyantz, A. and Sejnowski, TJ.  Ionic mechanisms for intrinsic slow 
:   oscillations in thalamic relay neurons. Biophys. J. 65: 1538-1552, 1993.
:
:
: 2. Simple first-order decay or buffering:
:
:       Cai + B <-> ...
:
:   which can be written as:
:
:       dCai/dt = (cainf - Cai) / taur
:
:   where cainf is the equilibrium intracellular calcium value (usually
:   in the range of 200-300 nM) and taur is the time constant of calcium 
:   removal.  The dynamics of submembranal calcium is usually thought to
:   be relatively fast, in the 1-10 millisecond range (see Blaustein, 
:   TINS, 11: 438, 1988).
